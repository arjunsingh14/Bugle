# bugle
A full stack web aplication that is news dashboard. Features user authentication/administration, so that user's can have their own custom news sources based on their preferences. Articles are pulled using the News API. 

The purpose of this project was to hopefully create an app that forces me to read the news more since I know where my sources are coming from and so that I could learn TypeScript, Redux, Tailwind CSS as well as brush up on React and Node/Express fundamentals for interviews.

## Frontend
- TypeScript
- ~~NextJS~~ React
- Redux
- Tailwind CSS
- ~~Webpack~~ Vite

## Backend
- TypeScript
